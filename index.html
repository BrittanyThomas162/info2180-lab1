      <p>
        My name is Brittany Thomas. I am currently pursuing a major in computer
        science and a minor in management studies at the University of the West
        Indies. My educational journey reflects my passion for technology and my
        desire to develop strong leadership skills. I am constantly seeking
        opportunities to learn new things and broaden my horizons. Exploring new
        places and immersing myself in different experiences is where I find
        inspiration and growth. Those who know me would describe me as highly
        motivated and driven to achieve my goals, consistently striving for
        excellence in all aspects of my life.
